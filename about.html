<!-- <h1>Experience</h1>
<p>I’ve had the privilege of working on numerous projects, from fashion and concert shoots to cultural events. Some of my favorite work involves documenting the dynamic celebrations of Indian festivals, where tradition and emotion come alive in every photograph. Additionally, I’ve conducted photoshoots for models that showcase style, personality, and professionalism.
</p>

<h1>Education & Skills</h1>
<p>I honed my skills and artistic vision at the Asian Academy of Film and Television (AAFT), where I received formal training in photography and media arts. My technical proficiency extends to working with high-end cameras and post-production tools like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, ensuring every image is polished to perfection.
</p>

<h1>Achievements</h1>
<p>I take pride in my work being recognized and featured in various platforms, from concert coverage to festival documentaries. Through these projects, I’ve built a reputation for capturing authenticity in even the most fast-paced environments.
